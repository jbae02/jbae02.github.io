      <h1>JinSeo Bae</h1>
      <p>I am currently living in Syracuse, NY.</p>
      <p>I went to high school in Hays, Kansas.</p>
      <p>I am from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" target="_blank">South Korea</a>.</p>
      <p>I am currently attending <a href = "https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a>.</p>
      <p>Even though I am majoring in Information Management and Technology (IM&T), </p>
      <p>I usually do things that are not related with technology for my hobbies: watching movies, collecting movie tickets, and trying new things.</p>
      <p>For my future, I will work at <a href = "https://www.google.org/" target="_blank">Google</a>!</p>
      <p>Google is my dream job since I was very young.</p>
      <p>I used dog photo to represent me, because I really want to raise a dog when I move out.</p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
